# moot

Moot is a micro-outlining tool. Micro-outlining means keeping a constant shorthand plan for what you're doing in order to:

* survive interruptions / resume work after a break by looking at the log of what you just finished
* reduce the penalty of task-switching
* communicate effectively about estimates & status

The UX is written in electron

## starting the UX

To use, check out the repo, run `npm install && npm start`, and get mooting.
